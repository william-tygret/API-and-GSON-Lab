## Exercise

#### Requirements

> ***Note:*** _This should be done in pairs._

You are provided with a handful of APIs to start with, which were briefly explored in the lesson, but you can choose any API you like from the [Programmable Web API Directory](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory). For this lab, you have to find an API (either pure REST or an API-backed SDK) and get data from it. You have to parse that data using Gson, creating the necessary classes.

One restriction: You ***cannot*** use the Walmart API or the Gmail SDK.

**Bonus:** Display that data in a meaningful way in an Android app

##### The APIs we discussed in the lesson

* [Marvel](http://developer.marvel.com/)
* [Yahoo Weather](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/)
* [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)
* [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/)

#### Deliverable

An Android Studio project, with no particular format. It just has to meet the above requirements.
